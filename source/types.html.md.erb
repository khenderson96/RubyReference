#Ruby Variables and Types

###Variables
* Local: starts with lower case or _
* Global: starts with $
* Instance: starts with @
* Class: starts with @@
* Constant: all uppercase (case of first letter determines mutability)

###Literals
* Numbers: integer, float, rational, complex
    * 83 -> integer
    *  3.1415 or 1.234e2 -> float
    *  0x -> hex
    *  0b -> binary
    *  2/3r -> rational
    *  5+3i -> complex
* Strings: delimited by "" or ''
    *  language = "Ruby"
    *  "#{language} is pretty cool" #=> "Ruby is pretty cool"
* Range: 1..10, 1...10
    *  start..end #=> includes start and end value
    *  start...end #=> does not include end value
* Arrays: [1, “Hello world”, [], true]
    *  can mix multiple object types
    *  dynamic sizing; append elements with '.push' or '<<'
    *  initialization methods:
        *  literal constructor: arr = [1, 2, 3] #=> [1, 2, 3]
        *  new keyword: arr = Array.new(3, 0)   #=> [0, 0, 0]
        *  block: arr = Array.new(3){\|x\| x = x * 3} #=> [0, 3, 6]
* Hashes: {'red' => 0xf00, 'green' => 0x0f0, 'blue' => 0x00f}
    *  maps unique key to values
    *  dynamic sizing
